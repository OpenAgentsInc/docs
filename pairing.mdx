## Overview

Tricoder uses a one‑time pairing code to connect your phone to the desktop bridge. The code includes your desktop host/IP, port, and a durable token.

## Generate a QR and deep link

```bash
npx tricoder@latest
```

What you’ll see
- Desktop IP: prefers Tailscale (100.x) or falls back to LAN IP
- WebSocket URL: `ws://<host>:8787/ws`
- Deep link: `openagents://connect?j=<base64url>`
- An ASCII QR you can scan from the app

App pairing
- Tricoder app → Scan Code on Onboarding or Settings
- Or tap the deep link on your phone to auto‑fill and connect

## Durable token

- The bridge enforces a token on non‑localhost binds to protect the control plane.
- The token is stored in `~/.openagents/bridge.json` and reused across restarts.
- The CLI reads/reuses the same token so you don’t need to rescan.

Rotate on demand

```bash
npx tricoder@latest --rotate-token
# or set TRICODER_ROTATE_TOKEN=1
```

## Manual entry

If scanning isn’t possible, enter the Desktop IP shown by the CLI. Use your Tailscale IP when available; otherwise use your LAN IP (e.g., `192.168.x.y`).

## Security notes

- Do not share your pairing QR or deep link.
- Keep token auth enabled when binding beyond `127.0.0.1`.
