## Mobile cannot connect

- Verify the bridge is running and listening on `0.0.0.0:8787` or your chosen bind.
- Check the host/IP: prefer your Tailscale IP (100.x); otherwise use LAN IP.
- Ensure the token matches your bridge (it’s persisted in `~/.openagents/bridge.json`).

## Tailscale not detected

- Log in to Tailscale on your desktop; confirm you have a 100.x address.
- If you prefer LAN, set `TRICODER_PREFER=lan` before running the CLI.

## LAN issues

- Confirm both devices are on the same subnet and no VPN is forcing traffic elsewhere.
- Check local firewall rules for port 8787.

## Token mismatch after reinstall

- Rotate intentionally with `npx tricoder --rotate-token`.
- If you copied configs across machines, ensure the mobile app is re‑paired with the new token.

## Still stuck?
