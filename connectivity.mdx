## Tailscale vs LAN

Recommended: Tailscale
- Works anywhere with internet; stable 100.x address
- Avoids router/NAT headaches; secure private tailnet
- Tricoder auto‑detects and prefers your Tailscale IP

LAN fallback
- Works when phone and desktop are on the same Wi‑Fi
- Uses a private IPv4 (e.g., 192.168/10/172 ranges)
- Tricoder auto‑selects a suitable LAN IP when Tailscale isn’t available

## Addresses and ports

- WebSocket: `ws://<host>:8787/ws`
- Default bind: `0.0.0.0:8787` (reach via Tailscale or LAN)

CLI flags and env
- `TRICODER_BRIDGE_PORT`: change the port (default 8787)
- `TRICODER_BRIDGE_BIND`: override bind (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8787` for localhost only)
- `TRICODER_PREFER`: `tailscale` or `lan` to override auto‑selection

## Security

- Token auth is required for any non‑localhost bind and is enabled by default.
- The token persists in `~/.openagents/bridge.json` to avoid rescans.
- Only use a localhost‑only bind without a token for explicit, short‑lived development.

## Troubleshooting

- Tailscale: ensure you’re logged in and the device has a 100.x IP.
- LAN: verify both devices are on the same subnet and the port (8787) is reachable.
- Re‑pair: use `--rotate-token` to rotate if you intentionally changed tokens.
