## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (for the bridge)
- Node.js 18+
- Tailscale (recommended) or same‑LAN connectivity

## 1) Clone and prepare

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents && cd openagents
```

Optional: use the Tricoder CLI to help print your desktop IP, generate a QR, and auto‑run the bridge.

```bash
npx tricoder --run-bridge
```

Notes
- Prefers your Tailscale IP (100.x) when available; otherwise falls back to your LAN IP.
- Binds the bridge to `0.0.0.0:8787` by default so both Tailscale and LAN addresses work.

## 2) Run the bridge (manual option)

If you prefer not to use the CLI helper, you can run the bridge directly:

```bash
cargo run -p oa-bridge -- --bind 0.0.0.0:8787
```

This launches the WebSocket at `ws://<host>:8787/ws` and sets up local sync.

## 3) Pair your phone

- In your terminal, `npx tricoder` prints a QR and a deep link.
- On your phone, open Tricoder → Scan Code (or tap the deep link) to connect.
- You can also manually enter your Desktop IP if needed.

## 4) You’re connected

The app shows bridge status and starts streaming runs. See Using Tricoder for basics (viewing history, sending prompts, interrupting runs).

Tips
- Keep Tailscale running for reliable remote connectivity.
- The bridge token is durable and stored in `~/.openagents/bridge.json` so you don’t need to rescan after restarts.
