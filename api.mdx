## Concepts

* The primary chat interface at OpenAgents.com allows users to interact with a variety of basic chat models and soon our
  meta-agent called "OpenAgents", which
  is
  composed of multiple
  Agents.

* Agents are built from interchangeable building blocks called Nodes which are organized into sequences called Flows.

* Example Nodes include: API endpoints, conditional logic, data parsing, and third-party integrations.

* Nodes can be created by community developers by uploading WASM plugins.

* Plugins are a special type of Node that allows for bespoke operations and enhanced capabilities.

* Each Node may have an associated fee, payable to its creator upon use.

* Nodes can reference an agent's Files.

* Users converse with Agents in conversations that are Threads of Messages.

* A Run is an instance of executing a Flow.

## Definitions

* **Agent** - An AI entity executing defined tasks
* **Thread** - A message chain between user and agent
* **Message** - A single communication in a thread
* **File** - Document processed or created by agents
* **Run** - The active execution of an agent flow
* **Flow** - A sequence of nodes
* **Node** - An individual task within a flow
* **Plugin** - A WebAssembly binary extending agent functionality
