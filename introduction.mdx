## What Is Tricoder

OpenAgents Tricoder lets you manage and steer your coding agents from your phone. It connects your mobile app to a local desktop bridge that runs and supervises the Codex CLI, streams live output, and syncs session history for quick context.

Highlights
- Tailscale‑first connectivity with seamless LAN fallback
- One‑time pairing via QR or deep link; durable bridge token
- Live streaming of messages, reasoning, and tool activity
- Offline‑first local sync using Tinyvex (SQLite + WS)
- Initial support: OpenAI Codex and Claude Code

## How It Works

- Bridge (Rust): boots locally on your desktop and exposes a secure WebSocket on `ws://<host>:8787/ws`.
- Tricoder CLI: `npx tricoder` prints your desktop IP, generates a pairing code/QR, and runs the bridge automatically.
- Mobile App (Expo): scans or opens the deep link to connect and control your agent runs.
