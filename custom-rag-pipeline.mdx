This guide will show you how to set up a RAG pipeline on your own hardware, you will need a pool already configured and running, see the [Running a Pool](/running-a-pool) for more information.

The RAG pipeline requires the following components:
- [**Document retrieval node**](#starting-the-retrieval-node): A node that fetches and transforms document into markdown from the web
- [**Embedding node**](#starting-the-embedding-node):  A node that converts documents and queries into searchable vectors
    - [**Using a local model**](#using-a-local-model)
    - [**Using OpenAI**](#using-openai)
- [**Search node**](#starting-the-search-node) : A node that creates indexes from the vectors and performs similarity searches
- [**Extism Runtime**](#starting-the-extism-runtime) : A general purpose node that runs Extism plugins. We will use it to run the RAG coordinator plugin
- [**The RAG Coordinator plugin**](#getting-the-rag-coordinator-plugin): A plugin that coordinates the other nodes and provides a single request endpoint for the pipeline


## Requirements
- A pool running on the same network. See the [Running a Pool](/running-a-pool) guide for more information.
- An host with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and configured (could be the same host as the pool).
- Basic knowledge on how to use a terminal and docker


## Starting the retrieval node

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name=retrieval \
    -ePOOL_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1" \
    -ePOOL_PORT="5021" \
    -ePOOL_SSL="false" \
ghcr.io/openagentsinc/openagents-document-retrieval
```

<Info>
Replace `POOL_ADDRESS`, `POOL_PORT` with the correct values for your pool.
</Info>
<Info>
If the pool is using SSL set `POOL_SSL` to `true`
</Info>

You can check the logs of the container with `docker logs --follow retrieval` to see if it started correctly.

<Info>
By default the node will use a random "NODE_TOKEN" to authenticate with the pool.
You can provide a custom token by setting a valid nostr secret in the docker command:
```bash
-eNODE_TOKEN="your_token"
```
Note: The token is communicated to the pool in plain text, so you should generate a new token only for this purpose.
</Info>



## Starting the embedding node

### Using a local model

You can use any local model that is compatible with the [Sentence Transformers](https://sbert.net/) library.
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name=embeddings \
    -ePOOL_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1" \
    -ePOOL_PORT="5021" \
    -ePOOL_SSL="false" \
    -eEMBEDDINGS_TRANSFORMERS_DEVICE="-1" \
    -eEMBEDDINGS_MODEL="intfloat/multilingual-e5-base" \
    -eEMBEDDINGS_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH="512" \
ghcr.io/openagentsinc/openagents-embeddings
```

<Tip>
You can run the model on a Nvidia GPU by setting `EMBEDDINGS_TRANSFORMERS_DEVICE` to the numeric id of a cuda device (eg. 0).
And by passing `--gpus all` to the docker run command.
Ensure you have the correct drivers and the [nvidia container runtime](https://developer.nvidia.com/container-runtime) installed.
</Tip>
<Info>
Replace `POOL_ADDRESS`, `POOL_PORT` with the correct values for your pool.
</Info>
<Info>
If the pool is using SSL set `POOL_SSL` to `true`
</Info>

You can check the logs of the container with `docker logs --follow embeddings` to see if it started correctly.

```bash
-eNODE_TOKEN="your_token"
```

### Using OpenAI
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name=embeddings \
    -ePOOL_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1" \
    -ePOOL_PORT="5021" \
    -ePOOL_SSL="false" \
    -eEMBEDDINGS_TRANSFORMERS_DEVICE="-1" \
    -eEMBEDDINGS_MODEL="openai:text-embedding-3-small" \
    -eEMBEDDINGS_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH="1024" \
ghcr.io/openagentsinc/openagents-embeddings

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name=search \
    -ePOOL_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1" \
    -ePOOL_PORT="5021" \
    -ePOOL_SSL="false" \
ghcr.io/openagentsinc/openagents-search
```
<Info>

    --name=extism-runtime \
    -ePOOL_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1" \
    -ePOOL_PORT="5021" \

## Getting the RAG Coordinator plugin

For this step your are going to need only the public direct link for a RAG Coordinator plugin, 
you can get one from the [openagents-rag-coordinator-plugin's Release page](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents-rag-coordinator-plugin/releases).

```
https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents-rag-coordinator-plugin/releases/download/v0.2/rag.wasm
```


## Testing the RAG Pipeline

If you've been following along, you should have the following containers running:
- retrieval
- embeddings
- search
- extism-runtime

all connected to the pool.

If that's the case, the rag component should be ready to use.


### Testing the RAG pipeline manually

You can now craft a nostr [NIP-90](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md) [**Job Request**](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md#job-request-kind5000-5999) to run the RAG pipeline.

<Warning>
Kind 5003 is a custom kind we use for generic openagents jobs, this might change in the future.
</Warning>

```json
{
  "kind": 5003,
  "created_at": $currentTimeInSeconds,
  "tags": [
    ["param","run-on","openagents/extism-runtime"],
    ["expiration", "$currentTimeInSecondsPLUS10mins"],
    ["param","main","https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents-rag-coordinator-plugin/releases/download/v0.2/rag.wasm"],
    ["param","k","1"],
    ["param","max-tokens","256"],
    ["param","quantize","false"],
    ["i","https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf","url","","passage"],
    ["i","The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.","text","", "passage"],
    ["i","Who invented bitcoin?","text","","query"]
  ],
  "content": ""
}
```
<Info>
Replace \$currentTimeInSeconds and \$currentTimeInSecondsPLUS10mins with valid values
</Info>

As you can see, this event calls the RAG coordinator plugin on top of an extism-runtime node, 
with some inputs ( **i** tags) with  one or more documents (as urls or plain text) marked with the "passage" marker,
and a query marked with the "query" marker.

After this event is broadcasted to the relay, you will receive a [Job feedback](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md#job-feedback) event
with `status=="success"` after which you will be able to get the job results by fetching 
a [Job result](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md#job-result-kind6000-6999) event of `kind==6003` *(5003+1000)*
and `e` tag equivalent to the **Job Request** event id.

<Warning>
If you are using a public Nostr relay, there might be other pools listening for the same kind of job,
so you might actually get the job results from someone else. 

To avoid this you can run your own private relay or enforce the use of a specific pool by setting your pool's
nostr public key in the `p` tag of the **Job Request**.

Additionally you can also **encrypt** the request for the same public key, using NIP-04 as explained [here](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md#encrypted-params).
</Warning>

<Tip>
See the [NIP-90 specification](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md) for more information on the protocol flow.
