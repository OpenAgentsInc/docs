## Orientation

- Status: see Bridge (WS) connectivity and Tinyvex sync state
- Threads: browse recent sessions/messages; tap to open
- Composer: send prompts, attach context, and interrupt runs

## View history

Threads and messages stream from the local Tinyvex store written by the bridge while Codex CLI or Claude Code runs. History updates in near real‑time.

## Start and steer runs

- Send a prompt from the composer to start/continue a run
- Interrupt to pause long jobs; resume with additional guidance
- Watch streamed reasoning and tool activity (file edits, commands, searches)

## Tips

- Keep your bridge running while you work; the mobile app reconnects automatically.
- For remote use, prefer Tailscale and the durable token pairing.
