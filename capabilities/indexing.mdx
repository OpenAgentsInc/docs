Agents with Codebase Indexing enabled can:
* Build an index of a specified GitHub repository
* Retrieve detailed information by querying the index with natural language

## Indexing a Codebase

Ask your agent to index a codebase. Agent will look for a github repo link plus the word 'index'

Example request:
> sup dude will you please index https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents

Example responses:
> Yes I will! It will take a few minutes and I'll add a message here when I'm done.

> No need, I already did. Ask away!
